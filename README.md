# NumericalOperations

## Introduction
In this lab you will apply numerical operations to perform calculations and print the results to the console

## Code Challenge 1

- [ ] Locate the NumericalOperations class. 

- [ ] In the lab guide you predicted the outcome of several numerical operations.  Here they are again below. Write print statements to print the following problems to the terminal EXACTLY as shown. 

     "Problem 1: -79 + 3 * (4 + 82 – 68) // 7 % 19 = "
     "Problem 2: (179 + 21 + 10)%7 / 181 ** 2 = "
     "Problem 3: 10 // 2 ** 2 + 10 % 2 = "

- [ ] Modify your print statements above to show the result of each problem.  Have java calculate the result and concatenate the result to the corresponding literal problem.  

## Code Challenge 2

- [ ] In the ModulusCalc class, write an algorithm that prints the modulus of any positive integer, without using the modulus operator.  Below is sample assignments for the integer and modulus and the corresponding output, 

|  number | modulus  | result |
|---|---|---|
| 1234  | 10  | 4 |
| 101010  | 2  | 0 |
| -2312  | 33  | 2 |

## Code Challenge 3

- [ ] Locate the class NumReverse
 
- [ ] Implement the number reversal code you wrote in the lab guide.  Your code should work for any 4 digit integer.  When your code is ran the original and the reversed number should print to the console.  Consider the examples below, 

|  number | result  |
|---|---|
| 1234  | 1234 --> 4321  |
| 6789  | 6789 --> 9876  |
| 1080  | 1080 --> 0801  |
